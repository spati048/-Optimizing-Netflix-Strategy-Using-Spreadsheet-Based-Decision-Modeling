# Optimizing-Netflix-Strategy-Using-Spreadsheet-Based-Decision-Modeling
Netflix’s success relies heavily on strategic investment in content across genres and countries. Our project analyzed Netflix’s global catalog to identify viewing trends, geographic opportunities, and data-driven budget allocations.

Tools & Libraries

Data Processing: Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables), Data Cleaning
Visualization: Excel Charts, Pivot Visualizations
Modeling: Excel Solver (Linear Optimization)
Analytics: Correlation Analysis, Descriptive Statistics
Presentation: PowerPoint (Executive Summary, Insights)

Dataset

Source: Netflix Titles Dataset (2024)
Size: 8,800+ titles
Features included:
Content Characteristics:
Type (Movie, TV Show)
Genre (Drama, Comedy, Documentary, etc.)
Rating (TV-14, PG-13, TV-MA)
Duration (Minutes or Seasons)
Country of production
Release year
Date added to Netflix

Derived Variables:
Weighted Genre Impact Score
Country Contribution Score
Budget Allocation Ratios
Target Output

Goal: Recommend optimal content investment distribution across genres and countries using Solver.
Objective: Maximize total “content value” based on genre prevalence and market opportunity.

Analytical Approach:
• Performed descriptive analysis to summarize global content trends
• Used correlation analysis to examine duration and release-year patterns
• Built an Excel Solver optimization model to maximize “content value” under budget and genre constraints
• Conducted scenario testing to compare different regional and genre investment strategies

Key Findings:
• Movies still dominate Netflix’s catalog, but TV shows have grown significantly with Netflix Originals.
• Drama, Comedy, and Documentaries are the most influential genres.
• India, Japan, and South Korea emerged as high-potential markets for future investment.
• Content duration has shortened over time, reflecting shifts toward high-engagement formats.
• Solver results recommended increasing investment in Asia while maintaining stable U.S./U.K. spending.
